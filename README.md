# When In Rome

I'm revisiting the React app I worked up for my [Germany Trip](https://github.com/bednar85/germany-trip). I plan on using this to filter / sort through a curated list of restaurants, cafes, bars, and museums for my upcoming trip to Rome.

## Details

[React Static Boilerplate](https://github.com/kriasoft/react-static-boilerplate) – I'm using this as the foundation for this version of my travel companion app

[Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) – I created a function using this library that looks through an array of JavaScript objects determine if that place is open or closed by comparing the current time to a moment object set using the hours of operation range hours, this is similar to the function  I created for Germany Trip but this one can account for multiple ranges
